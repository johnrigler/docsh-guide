As you see, the three sections above were created by running a command line 'second prompt' script which is shown in section '3'.  I have been using the docsh commands to create this example, but I also have been tweeking things with a command called 'docvi' which simply pulls up the raw HTML and allows me to edit it.

So if you are ready to use this, check out the installation page from the main menu:
