<div class=spacing>
  <div>

You will notice that the command above appears in a different sort of window than this text box or the very first one.  It is what I call a PRE element because it uses a preformatted tag.  This element is called a DIV because it is a formatted division tag.  The PRE element is nice for the command line because the output stands out and it won't get messed up by the HTML.  You may also notice that I have a strong desire to describe the mechanisms of 'docsh' with the help of the tool itself.  This is probably a bit confusing, so I am going to include some screen captures that might be helpful before returning to my explanation.  Once you have looked over them, take a look at the <a href=/3_example> 3_example</a> link for a more thorough description of how things work.
